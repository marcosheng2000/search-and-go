## 👨‍💻 Team & Roles

I was one of two developers responsible for the programming aspects of the project.  
We collaborated closely to implement the core functionality of the app.  
Other team members contributed with data management, backend support, and overall project coordination.  
My main contributions included:  
- Integrating the Deutsche Bahn public API to fetch real-time departure data  
- Displaying train stations on the interactive map using Kivy Garden MapView  
- Designing and implementing the user interface with Kivy

# SearchAndGo 🚆📍

**Developed at Jugend hackt 2025**

SearchAndGo is an interactive train station map app that helps users find nearby stations and see real-time departure information. It was built with Python and Kivy during a weekend hackathon.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time train departures using Deutsche Bahn’s public API  
- Interactive map using `kivy_garden.mapview`  
- Station markers with popup info  
- Simple interface with zoom and click-to-exit

## 👨‍💻 Team & Roles

We were a team of several participants. Only two of us focused on programming. I worked on:
- Connecting the Deutsche Bahn API
- Displaying the stations on a live map
- Handling real-time data and departures
- Designing the user interface using Kivy

Other team members supported the project with research and ideas. Some external datasets used during development were removed later.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Kivy (UI framework)  
- MapView from Kivy Garden  
- REST API / JSON  
- Deutsche Bahn API
